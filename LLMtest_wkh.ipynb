Dr. Smith knew that if a patient had a bacterial infection, they would need antibiotics. Therefore, John was prescribed a course of antibiotics. Furthermore, John had a high fever. Dr. Smith understood that if a patient had a high fever, they needed to be hospitalized. So, John was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and care. Dr. Smith also knew that if a patient needed antibiotics, they would recover in two weeks. Given that John had a bacterial infection, it was expected that with the right treatment, he would be well on his way to recovery in a fortnight. The medical team worked around the clock to ensure John's condition improved. As predicted, John's fever started to subside within a few days, and by the end of two weeks, he was on the path to full recovery.The medical staff was satisfied with the outcome, as it aligned perfectly with their expectations based on the premises they knew to be true. John was discharged from the hospital, feeling much better and grateful for the diligent care he received.\\n\"\n",

Dr. Smith knew that if a patient had a bacterial infection, they would need antibiotics. Therefore, John was prescribed a course of antibiotics. Furthermore, John had a high fever. Dr. Smith understood that if a patient had a high fever, they needed to be hospitalized. So, John was admitted to the hospital for close monitoring and care. Dr. Smith also knew that if a patient needed antibiotics, they would recover in two weeks. Given that John had a bacterial infection, it was expected that with the right treatment, he would be well on his way to recovery in a fortnight. The medical team worked around the clock to ensure John's condition improved. As predicted, John's fever started to subside within a few days, and by the end of two weeks, he was on the path to full recovery.The medical staff was satisfied with the outcome, as it aligned perfectly with their expectations based on the premises they knew to be true. John was discharged from the hospital, feeling much better and grateful for the diligent care he received.\\n\"\n",
